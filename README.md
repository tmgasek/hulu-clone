# Hulu Clone

My aim for this project was to create a website where the user can view and search for movies and TV shows. The data is provided by The Movie Database with version 3 of their database being used.

The website has 2 parts:
- The welcoming Home page, which is a direct visual clone of Hulu's official Welcome site which I used as a visual reference and made my own rendition of it using Tailwind CSS.
- The media viewing part of the site which queries TheMovieDB. I followed a guide to create a functioning skeleton of the app which queries movies. Then I expanded the app with a search function, TV Shows and detail views for single movies and shows.

### Technologies used
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

You can find the site live [HERE](https://hulu-clone-rho-ten.vercel.app/)

To run this site locally, clone this repo and use:
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`
