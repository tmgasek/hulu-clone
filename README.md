# Hulu Clone

This is my own partial clone of Hulu.com which allows the user to look up and view details about movies and TV shows.
I am using the The Movie Database as the API for querying all the data. (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

Technologies used:
- React.js
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS

You can find the site live [HERE](https://hulu-clone-rho-ten.vercel.app/)

To run this site locally, clone this repo and use:
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`
