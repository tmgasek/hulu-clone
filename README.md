# Hulu Clone

My aim for this project was to create a website where the user can view and search for movies and TV shows. The data is provided by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-GB) with version [3](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) of their database being used.

The website has 2 parts:
- The welcoming Home page, which is a direct visual clone of Hulu's official Welcome site which I used as a visual reference and made my own rendition of it using Tailwind CSS.
- The media viewing part of the site which queries TheMovieDB. I first made a skeleton of the app which queries for movies and shows them. Then I expanded the app with a search function, TV Shows and detail views for single movies and shows.

### Technologies used
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

You can find the site live [here](https://hulu-clone-rho-ten.vercel.app/)
